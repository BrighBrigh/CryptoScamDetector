# CryptoScamDetector
A twitter bot written in python to detect impostor accounts running scams.

# Setup
You will need to add all your own appropriate API keys to access the twitter API. Then add any authentic "@username" that you want to help protect to account_list (without the "@").

# Usage
Run this by issuing `python detector.py`

Feel free to share, modify, use, or distrubute all or any part of this code. I strongly encourage anyone and everyone to run one of these to help deal with abundance of scammers impostoring crypto-related twitter accounts until twitter does something to address this issue.
